\ comment=SLCF from STinyTim models for module sl
\ comment=Region of integration is X:   26.25: 73.75 Y:  48.50: 51.50
\ comment ks 17/08/05  -  v1.0 Derived in August by using STinyTim and assuming slit size 
\ comment ks 17/08/05        for Short Low to be: 57 x 3.6 arcseconds
\comment  ks 17/08/05  - v1.1 -- will need to derive exact slit size from later data
