Please reference this paper for published use of the tool.


Changes for Version 1.6
=======================

 - Updated Calibration sets for IRS pipeline version S17 (with
   particular improvment in LH order stitching).

 - CubeView: can now move box regions (histogram, stats, etc.) outside
   of zoomed area.

 - Prompt before clearing bad pixels.

 - Support reading/writing DS9 polygonal and circular regions (FK5 WCS
   coordinates only) for extraction apertures.

 - Display saved extraction regions on visualization image.

 - Reversable color tables.

 - Squash many small bugs.

Changes for Version 1.5
=======================

 - You can now directly load CUBISM-produced FITS cubes into CubeView.
   When opening a cube project (e.g. on the initial call to 'cubism'),
   select a FITS cube file instead of '.cpj' CUBISM project file.  Not
   all operations are possible when viewing FITS cubes, but you can
   extract, make line maps, etc.

 - Shipped with a calibration set for S15 IRS pipeline data.

 - A completely new clipping architecture speeds up the initial cube
   build ("colored rectangles" phase) by 4-8x.  This is true only for
   the auto-compiled C version (so it's even more important now to
   ensure IDL can find your compiler!).

 - The speed of a full cube rebuild ("marching white boxes" phase) has
   also been improved by a factor of 5-10.  These two improvements
   together make it far less important to save clipping accounts with
   the cube, since they can now be regenerated up to 10x faster.

 - QuickBuild: when toggling or loading bad pixels, CUBISM keeps track
   of which cube pixels are affected, and only rebuilds these "dirty"
   pixels.  Even for very large cubes, testing out a small batch of
   bad pixel changes is now very fast.  Look for the new "Build Cube"
   button in the CUBISM Project window to change to "QuickBuild".

 - Record-level bad pixels can now be marked on multiple records at
   once, when a stack of multiple records is being viewed.

 - Correctly handle spaces in path names.

 - Custom cursors in CubeView inform you which mode you are in (zoom,
   histogram, extraction, etc.).

 - You can now keep cube backtracking enabled while switching to
   another tool (e.g. zoom, you can now zoom in and then resume
   backtracking).

 - New option "These records" when right-clicking on a given pixel in
   the backtrack window, to set a record-level bad pixel in all the
   listed records with this pixel coordinate.

 - When the assembled cube is updated, automatically re-extract any
   existing extracted spectrum being displayed.  This is very useful
   with QuickBuild to check the effect of setting a small number of
   bad pixels on a (potentially spurious) spike in a spectrum.

 - New CubeView key shortcuts 0-4, to resize the display window to
   fixed sizes 1-4, with 0 meaning large enough to show the full image
   at the current zoom level.

 - Multi-extension FITS files can be read in as visualization images;
   you'll be prompted for which extension to read.

 - CubeSpec can make "integrated" maps, integrating f_nu d_nu, and
   converting the units (e.g. to W/m^2/sr).  Useful for line
   integrations.  

 - Weighted maps (e.g. MIPS 24um) are produced correctly, and can also
   be integrated over (weighted by d_nu, so the flux units are
   preserved).

 - The CubeSpec window can be resized.

 - On OSX, Cubism.app should correctly start X11 and target the
   correct X display for any version of IDL >= 6.1

 - Numerous minor bug-fixes and improvements.

Changes for Version 1.02
========================

 - Problems with the VM version quitting after any error is
   acknowledged, and incorrect handling of errors.

 - Single record only backgrounds complaining about the need to
   rebuild the cube.

 - Can now accommodate spaces in the filepath for the Cubism.app
   MacOSX version, and/or .cpj files (this may have been responsible
   for some MacOSX users reporting trouble launching Cubism.app).

 - Killing the window with window manager does not remove window until
   after prompting to save unsaved changes.

 - Simplified panning of zoomed images in CubeView: similar to DS9
  (middle or control-click to recenter).
