INTRODUCTION
============

This is the README file for the Cubism distribution, version 1.7.
Cubism is the CUbe Builder for IRS Spectral Mapping, a tool for use in
constructing and analyzing spectral maps obtained with the Spitzer
Space Telescope's IRS spectrograph.

Cubism was written by J.D. Smith and the SINGS Legacy team.

Cubism is available in two basic distribution types: source, and
binary.  A binary Cubism.app bundled package for MacOSX is also
available.


REFERENCE
=========

The Cubism algorithm and its implementation are described in detail
in:

         Sources, 2007 PASP, 119.1133S

REQUIREMENTS
============

 Source distribution:
 ++++++++++++++++++++

 - IDL, version 6.2 or later.

    http://www.rsinc.com/idl

 - The IDL Astronomy Library, version May 2004 or later.

    http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/

 - GCC or other C compiler.


 Binary distribution (including MacOSX Cubism.app):
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 - IDL, or the free IDLVM, version 6.2 or later.

   http://www.rsinc.com/idlvm/

 - GCC or other C compiler


REQUIREMENT NOTES
=================

 Both the source and binary version of Cubism are tested on Linux and
 MacOSX systems, but are not tested or supported on Windows.

 A default system compiler is strongly recommended, for auto-compiling
 a C helper library which speeds up basic cube building operations.
 Most Linux systems have compilers included by default.  OSX users
 should download and install the free Developer Tools (aka XCode,
 which includes gcc).

 To see what IDL will use to compile C code, type, at the IDL prompt:

 IDL> help,!MAKE_DLL,/st
 ** Structure !MAKE_DLL, 4 tags, length=48, data length=48:
    COMPILE_DIRECTORY
                    STRING    '/home/user/.idl/rsi/compile_dir-118-idl'...
    COMPILER_NAME   STRING    'GCC'
    CC              STRING    'gcc %X -fPIC -I"/usr/local/rsi/idl_6.1/ext'...
    LD              STRING    'ld -shared -o %L %O %X'

 IDL on OSX also requires X11 (installed by default starting with OSX
 v10.5); see the installation notes for IDL.


INSTALLATION
============

 Command Line Usage:
 +++++++++++++++++++

 If running either the source or binary Cubism distribution from the
 IDL command line, simply move the source directories into a location
 on the IDL_PATH, and restart IDL, if necessary.  An example IDL_PATH,
 for locating the directories in ~/idl, is:

   export IDL_PATH=<IDL_DEFAULT>:+$HOME/idl

 Virtual Machine Usage:
 ++++++++++++++++++++++

 If running from the IDL Virtual Machine, the directories can be
 located anywhere, and an IDL_PATH environment variable is not needed.

 OSX Binary Cubism.app package:
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 This binary distribution is bundled in a self-contained application,
 which attempts to run Cubism directly in the IDL VM when the
 application or a Cubism project ('.cpj') file is double-clicked.
 Simply drag the Cubism application to your /Applications folder, or
 anywhere else.

 If IDL is installed somewhere other than /Applications/rsi/idl, or
 /usr/local/rsi/idl (or equivalent paths with rsi->itt), set the
 global environment variable IDL_DIR to the location of the IDL
 install directory.


RUNNING
=======

 Source distribution:
 ++++++++++++++++++++

 Type:

 IDL> cubism

 at the IDL command line.  Assuming you have located the distributed
 directories somewhere on the IDL_PATH, it should offer a saved
 project selection dialog.


 Binary distribution:
 ++++++++++++++++++++

 For running Cubism within the virtual machine:

 % idl -vm=/path/to/cubism_vm.sav

 To use in a normal (licensed) command-line IDL session, type:

 IDL> cubism_vm

 at the command line.  This will automatically restore and run the
 compiled version of Cubism.

 OSX Binary Cubism.app package:
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 Double-click the application or a ".cpj" project file.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

Full documentation is bundled with each version of Cubism.  Choose
Help->Cubism Manual from the project window.


SUPPORT
=======

Support for CUBISM is provided by the Spitzer Science Center at
help@spitzer.caltech.edu.  Please identify the version of Cubism you
are using (see Help->About Cubism).


CHOOSING A DISTRIBUTION
=======================

Cubism can be run from either the source or binary distribution, at
the IDL command line, or in the freely available IDL VM (virtual
machine).

 Binary distribution, Command-Line IDL:
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
   Advantages: All necessary routines pre-compiled, no need to install
     external libraries.  Interaction and Cubism control available
     from the command line.  No risk of routine name collisions.

   Disadvantages: Less useful for debugging Cubism.  IDL license
     required.

 Binary distribution, IDL Virtual Machine (including MacOSX Cubism.app):
 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Advantages: All necessary routines pre-compiled, no need to install
     external libraries.  No risk of routine name collisions.  No IDL
     license required.  For OSX, ease of interface.

   Disadvantages: No interaction available from IDL command line.  Not
      useful for debugging Cubism.  Click-through IDL VM splash screen
      on startup.

 Source distribution, Command-Line IDL:
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Advantages: Interaction and control of Cubism and general analysis
      directly from the IDL command line (e.g. export
      cubes/maps/spectra to command line).  Ability to run multiple
      IDL tools concurrently.  Most useful for debugging Cubism.

   Disadvantages: IDL license required.  Routine name collisions could
      occur if many external libraries are installed.
